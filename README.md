### Hello, and Welcome!

I recently completed my dissertation research related to causal inference for multiple simultaneous continuous exposures as part of my Ph.D. in the Department of Biostatistics at UCLA. In the past I have worked on statistical methods related to censored regression and simulating longitudinal differential abundance of the microbiome. Many of these projects have resulted in R packages that I have authored including `tcensReg`, `mvGPS`, and `microbiomeDASim` which can be seen in the repositories.

I currently work for the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Quantitative Analyst.

I code primarily in R and use LaTeX for scientific writing. Some of my favorite tools to help my work are [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), which has been an extremely helpful way to work collaboratively on manuscripts written with LaTeX, and the `xaringan`  R package (<https://github.com/yihui/xaringan>) for creating presentations such as my [dissertation](https://williazo.github.io/presentations/propensity_project/Defense/defense_pres.html).

I enjoy hiking :mount_fuji:, spending time outdoors :tent:, and baseball :baseball:. Any feedback when implementing my projects here is always welcome. If you want to reach me you can :email: me at just.williazo@gmail.com.

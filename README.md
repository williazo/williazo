### Hello, and Welcome!

I'm currently working on research related to causal inference for multiple simultaneous continuous exposures as part of my Ph.D. dissertation in the Department of Biostatistics at UCLA. In the past I have worked on statistical methods related to censored regression and simulating longitudinal differential abundance of the microbiome.

I code primarily in R and use LaTeX for scientific writing. Some of my favorite tools to help my work are Overleaf.com, which has been an extemely helpful way to work collaborately on manuscripts written with LaTeX, and the `xaringan`  R package (https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for creating presentations.

I enjoy hiking :mount_fuji:, spending time outdoors :tent:, and baseball :baseball:. Any feedback when implementing my projects here is always welcome. If you want to reach me you can :email: me at williazo@ucla.edu.
